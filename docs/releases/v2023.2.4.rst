Bugfixes
--------

* Fixed an issue where Enterasys WS-AP3710i devices regularly boot with all-zero MAC-addresses in previous releases

* Detection of `swconfig` based switch architecture has been fixed (`#3309 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/3309>`_)

* Fixed an issue where the AVM FRITZ!Box 4040 used an incorrect primary MAC address
  (`Upstream <https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/87fbb5085d7e290b0ba536ad7d0876c4224723a6>`_)


Known issues
------------

* Unstable wireless with certain MediaTek devices (`#3154 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/3154>`_)

* The integration of the BATMAN_V routing algorithm is incomplete.

  - Mesh neighbors don't appear on the status page. (`#1726 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1726>`_)
    Many tools have the BATMAN_IV metric hardcoded, these need to be updated to account for the new throughput
    metric.
  - Throughput values are not correctly acquired for different interface types.
    (`#1728 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1728>`_)
    This affects virtual interface types like bridges and VXLAN.

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown
  (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* In configurations without VXLAN, the MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled
  (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promiscuous mode is disallowed).
